## FoodHub

**Business Description:** The number of restaurants in New York is increasing day by day. Lots of students and busy professionals rely on those restaurants due to their hectic lifestyles. Online food delivery service is a great option for them. It provides them with good food from their favorite restaurants. A food aggregator company FoodHub offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app.

The app allows the restaurants to receive a direct online order from a customer. The app assigns a delivery person from the company to pick up the order after it is confirmed by the restaurant. The delivery person then uses the map to reach the restaurant and waits for the food package. Once the food package is handed over to the delivery person, he/she confirms the pick-up in the app and travels to the customer's location to deliver the food. The delivery person confirms the drop-off in the app after delivering the food package to the customer. The customer can rate the order in the app. The food aggregator earns money by collecting a fixed margin on the delivery order from the restaurants.

### 1. Objective
The data is related to the orders made by the registered customers in their online portal.  
**Questions to Consider:**
- Analyze data to gain insight into the demand of the different restaurants in order to enhance the customer experience.
- Which are the top 5 restaurants in terms of the number of orders received?
- Which is the most popular cuisine on weekends?
- What percentage of the orders cost more than 20 dollars?
- What is the mean order delivery time?
- What is the net revenue generated by the company across all orders?
- What percentage of orders take more than 60 minutes to get delivered from the time the order is placed?
- How does the mean delivery time vary during weekdays and weekends?


### 2. Data Analysis

Utilized Python to analyze the data set

Data Description
*Rows and columns are present in the data* - 
```javascript
# use the shape method to determine the number of rows and columns of the data
df.shape
```
**Observations:**
(1898, 9)

*Datatypes of the different columns in the dataset*
```javascript
# Use info() to print a concise summary of the DataFrame
df.info()
```
**Observations:**
- There are 4 features (columns) which are int64
- There is 1 feature (column), cost_of_the_order, which is float64
- There are 3 features (columns) that are objects; however, the feature 'rating' should be an int64 or float64, so this should be investigated further.
- Some 'ratings' were not given; therefore, the data type is labeled an object.
- The ratings which were not given either have to be discarded, or the average of the rating for that cuisine or restaurant should be given.

*Missing values in the data*
```javascript
# determine if there are missing values
print('Missing Values')
df.isna().sum()
```
**Observations:**
- There are no missing values

*Statistical summary of the data*
```javascript
# use the describe method to determine the statistical summary of the data
df.describe()
```
**Observations:**
- The statistical summary was completed for all of the quantitative variables
- The order_id and the customer_id are not relevant for the statistical summary as they are identifiers
- The food_preparation_time statistical information:
- average: 27.371970 minutes
- minimum: 20 minutes
- maximum: 35 minutes

```javascript
## how many unique restaurant_names, cuisine_types and looking at other qualitative variables
df.describe(include = 'all')
```
**Observations:**
- There are 178 unique restaurant_names, with Shake Shack (219 orders) being the top restaurant_name
- There are 14 unique cuisine_types, with American (584 orders) being the top cuisine_type
- The most orders are made on the Weekend, with 1351 orders
- The rating should be an integer; however, because 736 orders have a rating of 'Not given' it is an object. And it shows that the majority of customers do not leave a rating.

*Number of orders that are rated / not rated*
```javascript
# determine the number of orders which are not rated
df.groupby('rating').count()
```
**Observations:**
- There are 736 orders which are not rated.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Univariate Analysis**
Explore all the variables and provide observations on their distributions. (Generally, histograms, boxplots, countplots, etc. are used for univariate exploration.)
```javascript
#Countplots for the qualitative variables
# displaying the 'restaurant_name' using a countplot
plt.figure(figsize = (25, 5))
sns.countplot(df.restaurant_name, order = df.restaurant_name.value_counts().index)

#add a title to the countplot
plt.title('Countplot of Restaurants by Name')

#rotate the xtick labels for readability
plt.xticks(rotation = 90)

# displaying the 'cuisine_type' using a countplot
plt.figure(figsize = (25, 5))
sns.countplot(df.cuisine_type, order = df.cuisine_type.value_counts().index)

#add a title to the countplot
plt.title('Countplot of cuisine_type')

#rotate the xtick labels for readability
plt.xticks(rotation = 45)

# displaying the 'day_of_the_week' using a countplot
plt.figure(figsize = (25, 5))
sns.countplot(df.day_of_the_week, order = df.day_of_the_week.value_counts().index)

#add a title to the countplot
plt.title('Countplot of day_of_the_week')

#set of boxplots of the quantitative variables
fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3)
#Boxplot for the cost_of_the_order
axs[0].boxplot(df['cost_of_the_order'])
axs[0].set_title('cost_of_the_order')

#Boxplot for the food_preparation_time
axs[1].boxplot(df['food_preparation_time'])
axs[1].set_title('food_preparation_time')

#Boxplot for the delivery_time
axs[2].boxplot(df['delivery_time'])
axs[2].set_title('delivery_time')

#adjust spacing for readability
fig.subplots_adjust(left=0.08, right=2, bottom=0.05, top=2,
                    hspace=0.5, wspace=0.5)

# set of distribution plots for the quantitative variables
# distribution plot for the cost_of_the_order
plt.figure(figsize = (15, 5))
sns.displot(df.cost_of_the_order, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of cost_of_the_order')
plt.xlabel('cost_of_the_order')
plt.ylabel('count')
          
# distribution plot for the food_preparation_time
plt.figure(figsize = (15, 5))
sns.displot(df.food_preparation_time, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of food_preparation_time')
plt.xlabel('food_preparation_time')
plt.ylabel('count')
          
# distribution plot for the delivery_time
plt.figure(figsize = (15, 5))
sns.displot(df.delivery_time, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of delivery_time')
plt.xlabel('delivery_time')
plt.ylabel('count')

#display plot
plt.show()
```

num_greater_than_20usd = greater_than_20usd.sum()

# to find the percentage of orders greater than 20usd, you will take the (number of orders greater than 20usd / total number of orders)*100
total_orders = df['cost_of_the_order'].count()

percent_orders_greater_20usd = (num_greater_than_20usd/total_orders)*100

print('The number of orders greater than 20usd is:', num_greater_than_20usd)
print('The number of total number of orders:', total_orders)
print('The percent of orders greater than 20usd is:', percent_orders_greater_20usd)

**Multivariate Analysis**
Perform a multivariate analysis to explore relationships between the important variables in the dataset.
```javascript
# create a pair plot to see if there are any relationships 
sns.pairplot(df)


# identify relationships between the cuisine type and the cost of the order
df.hist(by='cuisine_type',column = 'cost_of_the_order', figsize=(20,30))
