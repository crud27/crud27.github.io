# **Customer Loan Default Prediction**
## **Problem Definition**

### **The Context:**

 - A major proportion of retail bank profit comes from interests in the form of home loans. These loans are borrowed by regular income/high earning customers. Banks are most fearful of defaulters, as bad loans (NPA) usually eat up a major chunk of their profits. Therefore, it is important for banks to be judicious while approving loans for their customer base.

- The approval process for the loans is multifaceted. Through this process, the bank tries to check the credit worthiness of the applicant on the basis of a manual study of various aspects of the application. The entire process is not only effort-intensive but also prone to wrong judgment/approval owing to human error and biases.

- There have been attempts by many banks to automate this process by using heuristics. But with the advent of data science and machine learning, the focus has shifted to building machines that can learn this approval process and make it free of biases and more efficient. At the same time, one important thing to keep in mind is to make sure that the machine does not learn the biases that previously crept in because of the human approval process.

 - A bank's consumer credit department aims to simplify the decision making process for home equity lines of credit to be accepted. To do this, they will adopt the **Equal Credit Opportunity Act's** guidelines to establish an empirically derived and statistically sound model for credit scoring. The model will be based on the data obtained via the existing loan underwriting process from recent applicants who have been given credit. The model will be built from predictive modeling techniques, but the model created must be interpretable enough to provide a justification for any adverse behavior (rejections).

### **The objective:**
 
 - Analyze and build a classification model to predict clients who are likely to default on their loan and 
 - Identify important features to consider while approving a loan.
 - Give recommendations to the bank on the on a profile of the persons who are likely to default on their loan
 

### **The key questions:**

- What are the key questions that need to be answered?
- What were the average number of years at the job for the delinquent clients
- What were the top 3 Jobs of the delinquent clients
- What are the lengths of the top 5 delinquent lines of credit
- Which reason for the loan request, Home Improvement or Debt consolidation has the most delinquencies
### **The problem formulation**:

- What is it that we are trying to solve using data science?
- Using a classification model the bank should be able to predict which features or combination of features of a customer would likely default on their loan.

## **Data Description:**
The Home Equity dataset (HMEQ) contains baseline and loan performance information for 5,960 recent home equity loans. The target (BAD) is a binary variable that indicates whether an applicant has ultimately defaulted or has been severely delinquent. This adverse outcome occurred in 1,189 cases (20 percent). 12 input variables were registered for each applicant.

* **BAD:** 1 = Client defaulted on loan, 0 = loan repaid
* **LOAN:** Amount of loan approved.
* **MORTDUE:** Amount due on the existing mortgage.
* **VALUE:** Current value of the property. 
* **REASON:** Reason for the loan request. (HomeImp = home improvement, DebtCon= debt consolidation which means taking out a new loan to pay off other liabilities and consumer debts) 
* **JOB:** The type of job that loan applicant has such as manager, self, etc.
* **YOJ:** Years at present job.
* **DEROG:** Number of major derogatory reports (which indicates a serious delinquency or late payments). 
* **DELINQ:** Number of delinquent credit lines (a line of credit becomes delinquent when a borrower does not make the minimum required payments 30 to 60 days past the day on which the payments were due). 
* **CLAGE:** Age of the oldest credit line in months. 
* **NINQ:** Number of recent credit inquiries. 
* **CLNO:** Number of existing credit lines.
* **DEBTINC:** Debt-to-income ratio (all your monthly debt payments divided by your gross monthly income. This number is one way lenders measure your ability to manage the monthly payments to repay the money you plan to borrow.
