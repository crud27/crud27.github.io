### 5 Country Survey for Upper Primary Mathematics (Grades 4 - 6) 
- Researched the upper primary mathematics education system in 5 countries: Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Indonesia, and Pakistan
- Qualitative analysis by retrieving and aggregating data from over 75 sources and compiling it into a digestible and actionable format <br><br>
### Objective
- The focus of the study was to investigate the following areas:
1. Existing teaching and learning standards, materials, and national policies;
2. Exploration and analysis of the pedagogical quality of existing materials, performance standards, 
and national policies;
3. Analysis of gaps in both core and supplemental materials; and
4. Recommendations for addressing the needs in upper primary mathematics including pedagogical 
and curricular needs.<br><br>
