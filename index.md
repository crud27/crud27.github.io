### Qualitative Research - Writing Sample
### 5 Country Survey for Upper Primary Mathematics (Grades 4 - 6) 
- Researched the upper primary mathematics education system in 5 countries: Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Indonesia, and Pakistan
- Qualitative analysis by retrieving and aggregating data from over 75 sources and compiling it into a digestible and actionable format 
### Objective
- The focus of the study was to investigate the following areas:
1. existing teaching and learning standards, materials, and national policies;
2. exploration and analysis of the pedagogical quality of existing materials, performance standards 
and national policies;
3. analysis of gaps in both core and supplemental materials; and
4. recommendations for addressing the needs in upper primary mathematics including pedagogical 
and curricular needs.

### Quantitative and Qualitative Research - Survey 
### Survey Analysis Report- Upper Primary 
- Created a survey to gather insights from 121 teachers
- One hundred and twenty-one teachers participated in piloting the survey of 50 
questions, consisting of three types of questions: closed, free response, and problem-solving.
### Objective
The purpose of the study was to investigate: 
1. What are teacher beliefs regarding the nature of mathematics?
2. What is their pedagogical knowledge of teaching English learners?
3. What are their beliefs regarding teaching math to English learners
