## Overview

This research paper presents the comprehensive analysis of a survey conducted with 121 upper primary mathematics teachers in Ghana. The study investigates critical aspects of mathematics education in multilingual contexts, focusing on teacher beliefs, pedagogical knowledge, and practices when teaching mathematics in English to English language learners.

## Research Objectives

The study was designed to investigate three key areas:

1. **Teacher Beliefs**: What are teacher beliefs regarding the nature of mathematics?
2. **Pedagogical Knowledge**: What is their pedagogical knowledge of teaching English learners?
3. **Teaching Practices**: What are their beliefs regarding teaching math to English learners?

## Methodology

### Survey Design
- **Participants**: 121 upper primary teachers in Ghana
- **Survey Length**: 50 questions
- **Question Types**: 
  - Closed-ended questions
  - Free response questions
  - Problem-solving scenarios

### Research Approach
The survey was piloted to ensure validity and reliability across diverse teaching contexts in Ghana, where mathematics instruction occurs in English while many students are English language learners.

## Key Findings

The research reveals important insights into:

- **Teacher beliefs** about the nature of mathematics and its role in student learning
- **Pedagogical content knowledge** specific to teaching mathematics to English learners
- **Instructional strategies** teachers employ when navigating language barriers in mathematics education
- **Challenges and opportunities** in multilingual mathematics classrooms

## Significance

This study contributes to the growing body of research on:
- Mathematics education in multilingual contexts
