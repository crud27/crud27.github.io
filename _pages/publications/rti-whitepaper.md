## Overview

This commissioned white paper for **RTI International** presents a comprehensive desk study examining mathematics education in upper primary grades (four to eight) across five countries: Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Indonesia, and Pakistan. The research synthesizes available evidence to provide a comparative analysis of numeracy teaching and learning in diverse international contexts.

## Research Purpose

The purpose of this research was to explore and document:

- Current state of numeracy teaching and learning in upper primary grades (4-8)
- Teaching methods and pedagogical approaches across five countries
- Student achievement patterns and assessment results
- Educational policy directions and ministerial goals
- Contextual factors influencing mathematics education

## Countries Studied

The research examined mathematics education systems in:

1. **Kenya** - East African context
2. **Tanzania** - East African context
3. **Uganda** - East African context
4. **Indonesia** - Southeast Asian context
5. **Pakistan** - South Asian context

## Methodology
